This is my second approach to create cap on attributes. This time is not that deadly. I also incomporated potion consumpsion limit, heavily based on Alchemical Hustle mod. It can be used as replace to "Toxicity" module.

How it works:

Attribute cap is set to 100 + Endurance + Willpower + Level
Potion limit you can drink within 20 seconds window depends on Alchemy skill:

 < 20 -- 3 potions
 < 40 -- 4 potions
 < 60 -- 5 potions
 < 80 -- 6 potions
 < 100 -- 7 potions
>= 100 -- 8 potions

After you exceed that limit, your character will collapse with 0 Fatigue, Alchemy, Enchant and Armorer Skill until your attributes were lowered or potion cooldown ends.
